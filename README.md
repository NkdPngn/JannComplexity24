This project comprises scripts, results and statistical analyses of T1, resting fMRI, test fMRI runs 1 and 2 scans of >1500 subjects from the ABCD - OCD database of adolescent OCD patients and controls. The goal of the project was to highlight which brain areas and circuits are more involved in OCD patients vs. controls, and to determine relative brain complexity between the two groups.

The scripts can be found mainly in the files with names like "copying files"; results and lists of subjects are in the "text files" folders.
